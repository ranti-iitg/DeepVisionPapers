## Welcome to my page here I will discuss gist of some papers that I wil read



### [Do Convnets Learn Correspondence?](https://github.com/ranti-iitg/DeepVisionPapers/settings)
This paper main theme is do connvnets have spatial information stored in their feature space. Convnets perform very well on Classification and Object detection tasks beating all previous models, but what about visual correspondence.

It was believed that as the receptive fields of convnets are large they may loose spatial information but this paper have shown that despite having higher receptive fields convnets perform better than SIFT based correspondence approaches. In this paper author have discussed maily 4 tasks,
1. Feature Visualization
2. Intraclass alignment
3. Keypoint Classification
4. Keypoint Prediction

## Feature Visualization
In feature visualization author is trying to show that Similar Convnet features tend to have similar receptive field centers which authors show visually. Each feature vector at any layer coresponds to similar recetive field centers in original image, with increasing depth of layers and recetive field this feature space starts corresponding to more higher semantic meaning. for eg. in lower layers features have lower recetive fields and only correspond to edges etc whereas in deeper layers they start corresponding to features like nose eye etc, so if we take lets say a feature vector from 5th conv layer which whose recetive filed is centered at eye of cat, then if look for cosine similarity of this feature vector with all images in dataset and get lets say 5 nearest neigbours, from database if you see all those nearest neighbiurs receptive fields then althose recetive fields will have eyes, those eye may belong to humans or cats or dogs but sematically they will be eyes.
So we can say that feature vectors having similar meaning(cosine) in feature space, they corespong to same image patches which are present at their center of size stride\*stride.

Q) Question about this which arises in my mind is why all these feature vectors or even word vectors now even Z space by GAN follow cosine rule?

## Intraclass alignment


## Keypoint  Classification
Task of keypoint classification is to given an image and Coordinates of keypoint label that keypoint.
Author again compares this task with SIFT based methods and claims ConvNet based methods perform equally good or better than SIFT based methods. Given the coordinates of point we collect features from Conv5 layer(those features whose recetive field center lie close to those coordinates) author then train a simple SVM claasifier over those features in One VS All way and gets a Keypoitn Classifier. Also auther shows that near keypoint histogram performs far better for convnets showing better localization.

Q) Rather than selecting features based on coordinates and receptive field centers what if we train network end to end and what architecture to use for this training?

## Keypoint Prediction
Next task is keypoint prediction in this task given image we need to find keypoints in that image. Author takes each receptive filed and corresponding feature vector also we need to concatenate some more neigborig feature vectors and train SVM classifier on top of this, all receptive fields having keypoints give positive and all receptive fields not having keypoints give negative. author also discusses of increasing accuracy using Nearest Neighbour Spherical Gaussian on pool5 layer but thats not main point. Author again gets very high accuracy using this method than SIFT based method.

Q) Same type of question arises what about end to network can we use RNN for this?

## Conclusion Even with higher receptive fields convnets feture space preserve spatial information.
